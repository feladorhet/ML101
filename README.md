# Linear Regression Workshop

Welcome to the Linear Regression Workshop for the METU CClub 24-25 season! This workshop is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of linear regression, from its theoretical foundations to practical implementation using Python. By the end of this workshop, you will have a solid grasp of linear regression and be able to apply it to real-world problems.

## Overview

### What You'll Learn

1. **Introduction to Linear Regression**
   - Understanding the concept of linear regression
   - Mathematical representation of linear regression

2. **Implementation in Python**
   - Using `scikit-learn` for linear regression
   - Visualizing data with `matplotlib`
   - Performing mathematical operations with `numpy`

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Assessing the performance of linear regression models
   - Understanding key metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error, etc.

4. **Assumptions of Linear Regression**
   - Discussing the key assumptions behind linear regression
   - Techniques to check these assumptions

5. **Limitations and Overcoming Them**
   - Identifying the limitations of linear regression
   - Strategies to address these limitations

6. **Real-World Application**
   - Solving a real-world problem using linear regression
   - Applying the learned concepts in practice

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming
