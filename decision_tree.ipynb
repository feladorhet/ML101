    "In our previous workshop, we learned logistic regression, a strong classification algorithm that makes use of `sigmoid` function to predict the class to which the objects belong. Now, we are going to learn a new classification algorithm called `Decision Tree`. Decision trees are flowchart structures that resemble a tree, where an internal node  represents a feature (or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome."
