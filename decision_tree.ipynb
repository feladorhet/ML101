    "In our previous workshop, we learned logistic regression, a strong classification algorithm that makes use of `sigmoid` function to predict the class to which the objects belong. Now, we are going to learn a new classification algorithm called `Decision Tree`. Decision trees are flowchart structures that resemble a tree, where an internal node  represents a feature (or attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. Let's learn a bit more about tree data structure to have a better understanding of decision trees."

    "Very similar to the previously defined trees, the topmost node in a decision tree is known as the root node. It learns to partition on the basis of the attribute value. It partitions the tree in a recursive manner called recursive partitioning. This flowchart-like structure helps you in decision-making. It's visualization like a flowchart diagram which easily mimics the human level thinking. That is why decision trees are easy to understand and interpret.\n",

    "- Overfitting is a practical problem while building a Decision-Tree model. The problem of overfitting is considered when the algorithm continues to go deeper and deeper to reduce the training-set error but results with an increased test-set error. So, accuracy of prediction for our model goes down. It generally happens when we build many branches due to outliers and irregularities in data.\n",
    "- There are two main approaches to avoid overfitting, `Pre-Pruning` and `Post-Pruning`. \n",
    "- `Pre-Pruning`: We stop the tree construction a bit early. We prefer not to split a node if its goodness measure is below a threshold value. But it is difficult to choose an appropriate stopping point.\n",
    "- `Post-Pruning`: We go deeper and deeper in the tree to build a complete tree. If the tree shows the overfitting problem then pruning is done as a post-pruning step. We use the cross-validation data to check the effect of our pruning. Using cross-validation data, we test whether expanding a node will result in improve or not. If it shows an improvement, then we can continue by expanding that node. But if it shows a reduction in accuracy then it should not be expanded. So, the node should be converted to a leaf node."

    "### Cross-Validation\n",
    "Cross-validation is a statistical technique used to evaluate and improve the performance of machine learning models. It involves partitioning the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on some subsets while testing it on the remaining ones. The key objective of cross-validation is to assess how well the model generalizes to an independent dataset, i.e., how it performs on unseen data. Steps in `k-fold` are as follows:\n",
    "- `Shuffle the dataset`: Randomly shuffle the dataset to ensure that the data is well mixed.\n",
    "- `Split the dataset`: Divide the dataset into k equal-sized folds.\n",
    "- `Train and validate`: For each fold, use k−1 folds to train the model and use the remaining one fold to test the model.\n",
    "- `Calculate performance`: Compute the performance metric for each fold.\n",
    "- `Aggregate results`: Average the performance metrics across all folds to obtain an overall performance estimate."

    "    - - The model achieved perfect accuracy (1.0) on one fold, indicating that it correctly classified all instances in that fold.\n",
